Image Classification using CNN
Data Preparation:
The script extracts training and testing images from the directories as mentioned in the code.

Data Augmentation:
Data augmentation is performed using ImageDataGenerator to preprocess training images. It rescales pixel values to [0,1] and applies shear, zoom, and horizontal flip transformations to augment the training dataset.

CNN Model Architecture:
A Sequential model is used to build the CNN.

Convolutional layers (Conv2D) with ReLU activation capture image features.
MaxPooling layers reduce spatial dimensions of feature maps.
Flatten layer converts 2D feature maps to a 1D vector.
Dense layers with ReLU activation introduce non-linearity.
Final Dense layer uses sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Model Compilation:
The model is compiled with:

Adam optimizer
Binary crossentropy loss function (for binary classification)
Accuracy as the evaluation metric
Model Training:
The model is trained on the training dataset using the fit function for a specified number of epochs (e.g., 10).
Validation dataset (test_generator) is used to monitor model performance during training.

Model Evaluation:
After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset using the evaluate method.
The test accuracy is printed.
